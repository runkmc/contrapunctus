	exercises. In fact, if you desire some help, feel free to contact me.
	I would seriously be more than happy to give feedback. If you don't believe
	me, keep in mind that I wrote an online booklet about this very subject for
	kicks. That's how unbalanced I am. I like this stuff.}
	◊p{In the meantime, I've done the exercises myself, twice. First we will
	look at an answer with some errors. I'll ask you to try to find as many
	mistakes as possible, then I'll point them out myself. After that, I'll
	offer an example that is hopefully much better. Then, we'll do it all over
	again with the second exercise. Here we go:}

	◊p{There are only two mistakes in this example that break the rules I gave
	you in the last chapter. (There are some other problems with it, but that's
	for the chapter titled "Things I Didn't Talk About But Maybe Should Have.")
	The first mistake occurs in the movement between the fifth and sixth notes.
	I've written two intervals of a fifth, back to back. That's a no-no.
	Anytime you have consecutive fifths (or octaves), that's an error. The
	second mistake is in the ninth interval. I have an intervals of a fourth
	there, but that's a dissonance. Only consonances are allowed here.}
	◊p{Yikes. That one was rough. Here's a better example:}

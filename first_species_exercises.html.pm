	exercises. In fact, if you desire some help, feel free to contact me.
	I would seriously be more than happy to give feedback. If you don’t believe
	me, keep in mind that I wrote an online booklet about this very subject for
	kicks. That’s how much I like this stuff.}
	◊p{In the meantime, I’ve done the exercises myself, twice. First we will
	look at an answer with some errors. I’ll ask you to try to find as many
	mistakes as possible, then I’ll point them out myself. After that, I’ll
	offer an example that is hopefully much better. Then, we’ll do it all over
	again with the second exercise. Here we go:}

	◊p{There are only two mistakes in this example that break the rules I gave
	you in the last chapter. (There are some other problems with it, but that’s
	for the chapter titled "Things I Didn’t Talk About But Maybe Should Have.")
	The first mistake occurs in the movement between the fifth and sixth notes.
	I’ve written two intervals of a fifth, back to back. That’s a no-no.
	Anytime you have consecutive fifths (or octaves), that’s an error. The
	second mistake is in the ninth interval. I have an intervals of a fourth
	there, but that’s a dissonance. Only consonances are allowed here.}
	◊p{Yikes. That one was rough. Here’s a better example:}

	◊p{That’s better. I’ve avoided the mistakes from the first try, and it’s
	a more interesting melody as well. I’m going to reward myself with
	a delicious treat while you find the problems in this next exercise:}

	◊section-title{Exercise 2}
	◊p{Let’s start with the most obvious error. Remember earlier in this
	chapter when I said anytime you have consecutive fifths or octaves, that’s
	a problem? Look at the seventh and eighth notes. There they are again.
	That’s not the only problematic fifth in this exercise, though. There are
	two more. One of the rules states that when moving to a perfect consonance,
	you have to use either oblique or (preferably) contrary motion. That rules
	out parallel motion, as well as similar motion. While moving from the sixth
	to the seventh notes, we go from an interval of a sixth to an interval of
	a fifth. That’s fine, but we used similar motion to get there, which is not fine.
	I’ll leave it to you to find the other fifth that is arrived at by similar motion. (Hint: It’s the only other fifth
	in the exercise. I’m not as tricky as I originally thought myself to be.)}
	◊p{There’s only one other mistake in this exercise, but it’s one I make
	three times in a row. It’s much more subtle than parallel fifths, too. In
	the top line, the movement from the second note to the third note is a leap
	from B to F. That’s bad! That’s the one instance of a fifth that’s
	dissonant, and is the only leap of a fifth that’s forbidden within one
	line. If you keep going, you’ll notice that I proceed to leap back to the
	the B, and then back again to the F. Oh my. Here’s a better attempt:}

◊main-section{◊p{This short, online book was written to serve as a very basic
introduction to modal counterpoint for the beginner.}
	◊p{That being said, I really have no business writing such a work. This
	style of music was written by masters, and continues to be performed
	centuries later. There is a wonderful selection of textbooks on this
	subject both old and contemporary, written by some of the most
	knowledgeable teachers and musicians in the world, that beautifully lay out the art of music
	for anyone willing to dedicate the time and effort. (By
	“contemporary”, I mean “not translated from the original latin.”) I, on the
	other hand, am routinely outsmarted by the family dog, feeding him upwards
	of three dinners a night because I trust his memory of the event more than
	mine.}
	◊p{So why read this book? Well, most books on the subject assume the
	presence of an instructor. The reason for this is simple: this subject
	requires the presence of an instructor. There are elements of this practice
	that are quite subjective. Most subjective of all of them is the element of
	beauty. You can no more learn how to write beautiful and compelling
	counterpoint by reading a book than you can learn to take beautiful
	photographs by reading a camera manual. This book attempts to briefly fill
	in that gap for someone who might not have an instructor available. I have
	tried to further explain some things that other books assume prior
	knowledge of, and I offer poor examples along with more competent ones, so
	that the difference may be examined. I hope you find it helpful.}
	◊p{To navigate through the book, links to the previous and next chapters
	may be found on the top and bottom of each page, as well as a link to the
	table of contents.}}

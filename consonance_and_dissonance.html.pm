◊main-section{
	◊p{Now that we've learned how to identify the different intervals, it's
	time to learn how to classify them. Not all intervals are created equal,
	and the rules of counterpoint depend heavily on these different
	classifications. We will discuss which intervals are consonant, which
	intervals are dissonant, and the different types of consonance. In the next
	chapter, you will see why all of this matters.}
	◊p{If you've studied music theory, you'll quickly realize I'm leaving
	out quite a bit when it comes to the different qualities of intervals. This
	is intentional as these differences – with one exception I'll address
	shortly – don't really matter
	in modal counterpoint.}

	◊section-title{Consonant Intervals}
	◊p{The consonant intervals are the ◊em{third,} the ◊em{fifth,} the
	◊em{sixth,} and the ◊em{octave. Tenths, twelfths,} and ◊em{thirteenths} are
	also consonant, since these intervals are just an octave plus a third,
	fifth, and sixth, respectively.}
	◊p{These consonances break down further into ◊em{perfect consonances} and
	◊em{imperfect consonances}. The third and the sixth (as well as the tenth
		and thirteenth) are imperfect. The fifth and the octave (as well as the
	twelfth) are perfect. This distinction is important, as we will find out in
	the next chapter.}}

	◊p{◊em{Seconds, fourths,} and ◊em{sevenths} are all dissonant.}
	◊p{That's it!}
	◊p{Well, that's not entirely it. There is one more dissonance that you will
	have to watch out for. Here are a whole bunch of fifths:}
	◊img['src:"lilypond/dissonance1.svg"]
	◊p{Do you see that interval with a big X underneath it? That fifth is
	actually dissonant! Here's why: every other fifth in this example is
	exactly seven half steps apart, but this particular fifth, from B to F, is
	only six half steps apart. Instead of a ◊em{perfect} fifth, this
	forms a ◊em{diminished} fifth. This is the only interval in this system
	that can be consonant or dissonant depending on its location, and these are
	the only two pitches (B and F) that form it, so make sure
	you watch out for it.}

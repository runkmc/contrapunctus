	◊p{This short example features the three types of melodic motion 
	that we'll be discussing: ◊em{steps, skips,} and ◊em{leaps.}}
	◊p{A ◊em{step} is when a melody moves by the interval of a second. Here is
	the same example as before, but now with the steps all marked:}

	◊p{Skips are melodic movement by a third. This happens twice in the
	example; I've marked them below.}
	◊img['src:"lilypond/motion3.svg"]
	◊p{There is exactly one leap in the example below. A leap is movement by
	an interval of a fourth or more. This one is a leap of a fifth.}

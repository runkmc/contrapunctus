	◊p{An ◊em{interval} is the distance between two pitches. Being able to figure
	out the interval between two pitches is absolutely necessary when it comes
	to writing modal counterpoint. The good news is that if you can count to
	twelve or thirteen, you can master this skill pretty quickly.}
	◊p{Intervals are determined by the number of lines and spaces between two
	given notes. Observe:}

	◊p{Notice that instead of starting at zero, the interval between two
	identical notes is one. After that, they continue in a straightforward
	manner.}

	◊section-title{Interval Names}
	◊p{Intervals are generally referred to by their ordinal names. That is, two
	pitches that are separated by an interval of two form a ◊em{second,}
	pitches that form an interval of three form a ◊em{third,} and so on, up to
	an ◊em{eleventh} and a ◊em{twelfth} in the above example. There are two
	exceptions to this rule. Identical pitches (that is, pitches with an interval 
	of one) are usually referred to as a ◊em{unison}, and pitches separated by an
	interval of eight are referred to as an ◊em{octave.}}

	◊p{If you've ever sung in a choir or played an instrument, you might be
	familiar with the notes of the ◊em{staff} with a ◊em{treble clef:}}
	◊img['src:"lilypond/pitches1.svg"]
	◊p{Only slight less familiar is the ◊em{bass clef.} Note that the C at the
	very top of the bass clef example is the exact same pitch as the lowest C on
	the above treble clef example (sometimes called "middle C")}
	◊img['src:"lilypond/pitches2.svg"]
	◊p{The last clef we'll be using (and one I'll be introducing gradually) is
	the ◊em{alto clef.} This clef places middle C on the third line, in the
	very center of the staff.}
	◊img['src:"lilypond/pitches3.svg"]
	◊p{Knowing how these clefs relate to each other is going to be very
	important from this point on. It will be awkward at first, but the more you
	practice the later exercises, the easier it will become.}

	◊section-title{Intervals}
	◊p{An ◊em{interval} is the distance between two pitches. Being able to figure
	out the interval between two pitches is absolutely necessary when it comes
	to writing modal counterpoint. The good news is that if you can count to
	twelve or thirteen, you can master this skill pretty quickly.}
	◊p{Intervals are determined by the number of lines and spaces between two
	given notes. Observe:}
	◊img['src:"lilypond/intervals1.svg"]
	◊p{Notice that instead of starting at zero, the interval between two
	identical notes is one. After that, they continue in a straightforward
	manner.}

◊main-section{
	◊section-title{Interval Names}
	◊p{Intervals are generally referred to by their ordinal names. That is, two
	pitches that are separated by an interval of two form a ◊em{second,}
	pitches that form an interval of three form a ◊em{third,} and so on, up to
	an ◊em{eleventh} and a ◊em{twelfth} in the above example. There are two
	exceptions to this rule. Identical pitches (that is, pitches with an interval 
	of one) are usually referred to as a ◊em{unison}, and pitches separated by an
	interval of eight are referred to as an ◊em{octave.}}

◊main-section{
	◊section-title{Exercises}
	◊p{See if you can figure out the intervals between each of these pairs of
	pitches. You can find the answers at the end of the next chapter (hint:
	the first one is a unison.)}

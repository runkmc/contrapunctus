	◊p{That was kind of abrupt. Sorry. You’ve reached the end, though. Good for
	you!}
	◊p{If you want to keep going, there are lots of wonderful books out there.
	My three favorites are ◊a['href: "http://www.amazon.com/Modal-Counterpoint-Renaissance-Peter-Schubert/dp/019533194X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1422167927&sr=8-1&keywords=modal+counterpoint"]{Modal Counterpoint},

	There are other good books, but those are three of my favorites.}
	◊p{The best thing you can do, however, is join a class. I stated at the
	beginning of the book that an instructor is vital to truly understanding
	this, and it really is true. Most four year colleges that offer degrees in
	music should probably offer this course occasionally, and I wouldn’t be
	surprised to find it at some community colleges with substantial music
	departments as well. }
	◊p{Otherwise, you can always contact me here with questions or with
	exercises that you would like feedback on. Trust me, I like it.}
	◊p{Thanks for reading!}}

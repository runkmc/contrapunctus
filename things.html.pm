	◊p{That was kind of abrupt. Sorry. You’ve reached the end, though. Good for
	you!}
	◊p{As the title of this chapter mentions, there is quite a bit I left out
	in this very basic introduction. I didn't mention any of the modes, or the
	difference between major and minor intervals. I left out some of the
	elements that make a melodic line interesting. Most notably, I didn't
	mention anything past first species, leaving the remaining four out
	completely. If you're interested, there is much, much more to explore.}
	◊p{If you want to keep going, there are lots of wonderful books out there.
	My three favorites are ◊a['href: "http://www.amazon.com/Modal-Counterpoint-Renaissance-Peter-Schubert/dp/019533194X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1422167927&sr=8-1&keywords=modal+counterpoint"]{Modal Counterpoint}, 
	◊a['href: "http://www.amazon.com/Counterpoint-Polyphonic-Vocal-Sixteenth-Century/dp/048627036X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1422168094&sr=8-1&keywords=counterpoint+knud"]{Counterpoint: The Polyphonic Vocal Style of the Sixteenth Century}, and 
	◊a['href:
	"http://www.amazon.com/Study-Counterpoint-Johann-Joseph-Parnassum/dp/0393002772/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1422168190&sr=8-1&keywords=steps+to+parnassus"]{Study of Counterpoint}. 
	There are other good books, but those are three of the best.}
	◊p{If you are truly interested in this subject, however, I highly recommend joining a class. I stated at the
	beginning of the book that an instructor is vital to truly understanding
	modal counterpoint, and it really is true. Most four year colleges that offer degrees in
	music should offer this course occasionally, and I wouldn’t be
	surprised to find it at some community colleges with substantial music
	departments as well. }
	◊p{Otherwise, you can always contact me ◊span['id:"obf"]{◊script{document.getElementById("obf").innerHTML="<n uers=\"znvygb:xriva.zptynqqrel@tznvy.pbz\" gnetrg=\"_oynax\">urer</n>".replace(/[a-zA-Z]/g,function(c){return String.fromCharCode((c<="Z"?90:122)>=(c=c.charCodeAt(0)+13)?c:c-26);});document.body.appendChild(eo);}◊noscript{◊span['style:"unicode-bidi:bidi-override;direction:rtl;"]{moc.liamg@yreddalgcm.nivek}}} with questions or with
	exercises that you would like feedback on. Trust me, I like it.}
	◊p{Thanks for reading!}}

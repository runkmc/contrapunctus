	◊p{If your vision isn't too blurred from all that trembling with excitement
	you're undoubtedly experiencing, it's time to prepare for your very first
	counterpoint exercise.}
	◊p{Here is how this is going to go down. I'm going to give you a melody,
	and you're going to write a second melody above it. Before we begin, we
	will talk a little about the melody I'm giving you, as well as the rules for
	writing your melody.}}
◊main-section{◊section-title{The Cantus Firmus}
	◊p{Every melody I give you from here on out in the various exercises will
	be referred to as a ◊term{cantus firmus.} This roughly translates to
	◊em{fixed melody,} and it means that you're not allowed to change it no
	matter how much you may want to so ha ha ha deal with it. The only thing you're allowed
	to create or change in these exercises is your own melody. A cantus firmus
	will look something like this:}
	◊img['src:"lilypond/cantus-firmus-example.svg"]
	◊p{There are a couple of characteristics found here that almost every cantus firmus
	will have. They will all be made up of a series of whole notes, and they
	will always start and end on the same note. Their length can vary, but most
	of them will be between eight and ten notes long. I'll also always
	give them to you in alto clef. This is mostly because learning alto clef is
	good for you, and only partially because I hate you and want you to feel
	pain.

◊main-section{◊section-title{First Species Rules}
	◊p{Now before your can start your exercise, you need to know the rules for
	writing first species counterpoint. What, did you think there were no
	rules? Of course there are rules. Without rules, we would descend into
	madness like that kid in ◊em{Lord of the Flies.} You know. That book with
	the flies. And the kid. Who was the lord of them.}
	◊p{There is some good news and bad news about the rules. The bad news is
	that there are a lot of them. The good news is that most of them hold for
	all the exercises we will be doing for the rest of the book, sometimes with
	slight variations. To help keep track of them, I'm going to break them down
	into a few different groupings. First, here is the most important rule in
	first species counterpoint:}
		◊ul{
			◊li{For every note in the cantus firmus, you will have one
			corresponding note in your own melody.}
			}
	◊p{Easy enough, right? Here are some rules having to do with intervals:}
		◊ul{
			◊li{Every interval between each note in the cantus firmus and your
			melody has to be consonant.}
			◊li{The first and last intervals of the entire exercise need to be
			perfect consonances.}
			◊li{Your melody may never leap from F to B or the inverse, from
			B to F.}}

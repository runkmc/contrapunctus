	◊p{If your vision isn't too blurred from all that trembling with excitement
	you're undoubtedly experiencing, it's time to prepare for your very first
	counterpoint exercise.}
	◊p{Here is how this is going to go down. I'm going to give you a melody,
	and you're going to write a second melody above it. Before we begin, we
	will talk a little about the melody I'm giving you, as well as the rules for
	writing your melody.}}
◊main-section{◊section-title{The Cantus Firmus}
	◊p{Every melody I give you from here on out in the various exercises will
	be referred to as a ◊term{cantus firmus.} This roughly translates to
	◊em{fixed melody,} and it means that you're not allowed to change it no
	matter how much you may want to so ha ha ha deal with it. The only thing you're allowed
	to create or change in these exercises is your own melody. A cantus firmus
	will look something like this:}
	◊img['src:"lilypond/cantus-firmus-example.svg"]
	◊p{There are a couple of characteristics found here that almost every cantus firmus
	will have. They will all be made up of a series of whole notes, and they
	will always start and end on the same note. Their length can vary, but most
	of them will be between eight and ten notes long. I'll also always
	give them to you in alto clef. This is mostly because learning alto clef is
	good for you, and only partially because I hate you and want you to feel
	pain.
	}}
◊main-section{◊section-title{First Species Rules}
	◊p{Now before your can start your exercise, you need to know the rules for
	writing first species counterpoint. What, did you think there were no
	rules? Of course there are rules. Without rules, we would descend into
	madness like that kid in ◊em{Lord of the Flies.} You know. That book with
	the flies. And the kid. Who was the lord of them.}
	◊p{There is some good news and bad news about the rules. The bad news is
	that there are a lot of them. The good news is that they make sense when it
	comes time to actually use them. 
	To help keep track of them, I'm going to break them down
	into a few different groupings. First, here is the most important rule in
	first species counterpoint:}
		◊rules{
			◊li{For every note in the cantus firmus, you will have one
			corresponding note in your own melody.}
			}
	◊p{Easy enough, right? Here are some rules having to do with intervals:}
		◊rules{
			◊li{Every interval between each note in the cantus firmus and your
			melody has to be consonant.}
			◊li{The first and last intervals of the entire exercise need to be
			perfect consonances.}
			◊li{Your melody should never be more than a twelfth away from the
			cantus firmus. You can briefly push that to a thirteenth if it
			makes a really nice line, but that's it.}}
	◊p{Here are some rules regarding motion within your own melody:}
		◊rules{
			◊li{Prefer stepwise movement melody over skips and leaps.
			At least half of your movement should be stepwise.}
			◊li{After a leap up or down, move stepwise in the opposite
			direction.}
			◊li{Never use two leaps in the same direction back to back. Two
			skips in the same direction are ok, as long as you don't do it too
			often.}
			◊li{Your melody may never leap from F to B or the inverse, from
			B to F.}
			◊li{Avoid downward leaps larger than a fifth.}
			◊li{Avoid upward leaps larger than a fifth.}
			◊li{You may leap an octave in either direction.}
			}
	◊sidebar{A quick note about rule #6: If I were being strict, I would 
	allow ascending leaps of minor sixths, but not major sixths. I didn't
	cover major/minor intervals, but if you know what I'm talking about, you
	may use ascending minor sixths. I'll talk a little more about this
	in the chapter titled “Things I Didn't Talk About But Maybe Should Have.”}
	◊p{Finally, here are some rules about motion between your melody and the
	cantus firmus:}
		◊rules{
			◊li{When moving to an imperfect consonance, any of the types of
			motion (that is, parallel, oblique, similar, and contrary) are fine
			to use.}
			◊li{When moving to a perfect consonance, you have to use either
			oblique or (preferably) contrary motion.}
			◊li{Use oblique motion rarely. Keeping your melody motionless in
				order to form oblique motion with a cantus firmus is fine, but
				using it more than twice every eight to twelve notes is too
				much. Keep it to a maximum of twice per exercise for now.}
			◊li{Only use parallel motion for a maximum of four notes at a time.
			Too much parallel motion, and your line will start to lose some of
			its independence.}}
	◊p{OH MAN that's a lot of rules. For the exercises, I'm going to do
	something special. I'm going to do them along with you. In both
	examples, I'm going to intentionally make some mistakes and break some
	rules so you can see what not to do. Keep in mind that I am making
	these mistakes on purpose. As you can imagine, I am usually perfect
	otherwise.}
	}
◊main-section{◊section-title{Exercises}
	◊p{I am going to give you two different cantus firmi (that's the correct
	pluralization, as opposed to “cantus firmuses” which is actually more fun
	to say). You job will be to write a corresponding melody ◊em{above} each
	cantus firmus, keeping all of the rules mentioned in mind. (Hint:
	your melody should probably be in treble clef.) This will take you some time,
	and you'll probably make a lot of mistakes. Don't worry about that. Making
	mistakes is the best way to learn. See you in the next chapter.
